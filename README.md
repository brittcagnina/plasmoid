========

A basic 2D, top-down game with HTML5 and Javascript.

The atlas.png file was generated using a useful tool (free and available for windows, mac, and linux) called 
TexturePacker and is available at http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker

Many of the design decisions were influenced by the html5 game GRITS and helpful tutorials by Colt McAnlis
